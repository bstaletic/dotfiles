I currently use the following software:
1. GUI browser - Iceweasel
2. CLI browser - elinks
3. Shell - zsh
4. Music player - mpd + ncmpcpp (mpc for dwm bindings)
5. Video player - mplayer (framebuffer) + mpv (xorg)
6. Terminal multiplexer - tmux
7. Text editor - vim*
8. File manager - vifm
9. Window manager - DWM

There are config files for other software in this repo, but the above is what I actively use. Thus configuration files for the aforementioned software is the most up to date.

* Take a look at the README file in .vim directory.
