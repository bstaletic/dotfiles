# dotfiles
I currently use the following software:
- GUI browser - surf
- CLI browser - elinks
- Shell - zsh
- Music player - mpd + ncmpcpp (mpc for dwm bindings)
- Video player - mplayer (framebuffer) + mpv (xorg)
- Terminal multiplexer - tmux
- Text editor - vim
- File manager - vifm
- Window manager - DWM

There are config files for other software in this repo, but the above is what I actively use. Thus configuration files for the aforementioned software is the most up to date.
