Currently I have a few vim plugins installed as system packages, so this dir may look a bit empty. I'm going to replace all packages with manually installed plugins, so everything would be visible.

Current situation:
	plugins installed using package manager:
		clang-complete
		fugitive
		supertab
		syntastic
		ultisnips
	manually installed plugins:
		easymotion
		signature
